# Counter

Simple [tally counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_counter) for Android. It makes counting easier! You can have multiple counters with their own names and values. Values can be changed using the volume buttons or by tapping on the screen. All your data can be exported in CSV format.

> [!WARNING]  
> **Note that the app is currently not available from Google Play Store, and I'm not sure if it ever will be again.** See [the section below](#google-play) for details.

## Google Play

Google decided to terminate my developer account for no apparent reason, so Counter is no longer available on the Play Store. I've never received any notices or warnings before this. Counter was the only app that I [published on the Play Store](https://web.archive.org/web/20250121131910/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.tsukanov.counter) for over 12 years. Before removal, it was installed on over 500k active devices, was downloaded over 1 million times and had 4.5 rating with almost 6.5k reviews.

This is the notice which I received:

Some screenshots from by developer dashboard before I lost access to it:
